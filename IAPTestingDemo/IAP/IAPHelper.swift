        /*
         
         https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/StoreKitGuide/PromotingIn-AppPurchases/PromotingIn-AppPurchases.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008267-CH11-SW1
         
         When a user taps or clicks Buy on an in-app purchase on the App Store, StoreKit automatically opens your app and
         sends the transaction information to your app through the delegate method paymentQueue(_:shouldAddStorePayment:for).
         Your app must complete the purchase transaction and any related actions that are specific to your app.
         
         If your app is not installed when the user taps or clicks Buy, the App Store automatically downloads the app or
         prompts the user to buy it. The user gets a notification when the app installation is complete. This method is
         called when the user taps the notification.
         
         Otherwise, if the user opens the app manually, this method is called only if the app is opened soon after the
         purchase was started.
         
         You should make sure not to show popups or any other UI that will get in the way of the user purchasing the in-app
         purchase.
         
         Return true to continue the transaction, false to defer or cancel the transaction.
         
             * You should cancel (and provide feedback to the user) if the user has already purchased the product
             * You may wish to defer the purchase if the user is in the middle of something else critcial in your app.
         
         If you defer, you can re-start the transaction later by:
         
             * saving the payment passed to paymentQueue(_:shouldAddStorePayment:for)
             * returning false from paymentQueue(_:shouldAddStorePayment:for)
             * calling SKPaymentQueue.default().add(savedPayment) later to re-start the purchase
         
         Testing
         -------
         To test your promoted in-app purchases before your app is available in the App Store, Apple provides a system
         URL that triggers your app using the itms-services:// protocol.
         
             * Protocol: itms-services://
             * Parameter action: purchaseIntent
             * Parameter bundleId: bundle Id for your app (e.g. com.rarcher.writerly)
             * Parameter productIdentifier: the in-app purchase product name you want to test
         
         The URL looks like this:
         
         itms-services://?action=purchaseIntent&bundleId=com.company.appname&productIdentifier=product_name
         
         Examples for testing Writerly:
         
         itms-services://?action=purchaseIntent&bundleId=com.rarcher.writerly&productIdentifier=com.rarcher.writerly.waysintocharacter
         itms-services://?action=purchaseIntent&bundleId=com.rarcher.writerly&productIdentifier=com.rarcher.writerly.ayearofprompts
         
         Send this URL to yourself in an email or iMessage and open it from your device. You will know the test is
         running when your app opens automatically. You can then test your promoted in-app purchase.
